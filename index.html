                    <h2>What I've Done</h2>
                    <p>Until May of 2018, most of my professional career was spent literally herding cats! I spent 5 years in Animal Welfare and gained skills in nearly every aspect in the industry from direct animal care, volunteer management, grant administration and management, program management as well as feline behavior. My greatest love in animal welfare is working with community (feral) cats through Trap Neuter Return and working cats and I remain active by continuining to volunteer with these programs. </p>

                    <h2>What I am Doing</h2>
                    <p>I am currently self learning web development full time! After attending a Railsbridge workshop in NC in February 2018, I've realized that I most enjoy doing backend work. I'm working on a few personal portfolio projects in addition to online coursework.</p>
